  "prompt": "## Question\n\nBased on the provided task description, data schema, and domain knowledge, determine the necessary analysis processes for this task. Consider not only the stated objectives but also assess whether the available data supports these analyses. Exclude any processes that cannot be performed due to data limitations. \n\n## Note\n\n- Start with the predefined analyses listed below.\n- Include additional analyses you find necessary to meet the task objectives.\n- DO NOT include processes unsupported by the available data.\n- Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to ensure the correct analyses are selected. Summarize the results in the following JSON format:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"NAME_OF_ANALYSIS_1\": \"YOUR_REASON_TO_PERFORM_ANALYSIS_1\",\n  \"NAME_OF_ANALYSIS_2\": \"YOUR_REASON_TO_PERFORM_ANALYSIS_2\"\n}\n```\n\n## Spatial Analysis\n\n- Distance: Evaluate spatial distances between locations, road segments, or regions. Useful for analyzing mobility patterns, travel time, and proximity-based effects.  \n- Direction: Analyze qualitative or quantitative directional relationships (e.g., left/right, north/south) between locations for navigation or spatial reasoning.  \n- Adjacency: Investigate topological relationships such as connectivity or adjacency in spatial graphs (e.g., n-hop neighbors).  \n\n## Temporal Analysis\n\n- Chronology: Examine the sequential order of events to identify temporal dependencies or patterns (e.g., POI visit sequences).  \n- Duration: Analyze time spans associated with events or processes (e.g., travel time, waiting time).  \n- Trend: Identify long-term patterns in time-series data to understand evolving behaviors or temporal dynamics (e.g., traffic flow trends).  \n- Local Extrema: Detect and interpret peaks and troughs in time-series data (e.g., rush hours, high-demand periods).  \n- Periodicity: Analyze recurring cycles in time-series data, such as daily, weekly, or seasonal behaviors (e.g., periodic traffic variations).  \n\n## Other Analysis\n\n- Numerical Comparison: Perform comparative analyses on quantitative variables (e.g., distance, duration, demand, frequency).
